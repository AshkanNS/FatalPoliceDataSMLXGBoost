Supervised Machine Learning with XGBoost has been used to classify fatal police shootings data. 
The model was optimized and evaluated using GridSearchCV and achieved 100% accuracy. 
Key features influencing predictions were age, race, and body camera usage.

Improvements:
- Risk of overfitting should be addressed with cross-validation and expanded hyperparameter tuning.
- Feature selection techniques could further enhance model performance.

Business Value:
- The model provides predictive insights to help prevent fatal incidents in police operations.
- It enables data-driven decisions, improves strategic resource allocation, and saves time by automating analysis.
- Long-term improvements are possible as the model can evolve with new data.

This tool is valuable for making objective decisions, optimizing resources, and ensuring continuous improvement in operational effectiveness.
